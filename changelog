Changelog
=========

Version 1.4.10b (Beta)
Add error handling around failed echo return pulses.

Version 1.4.0

Allow changing the default sample_wait from 0.1 seconds to a faster
interval.  This is the speed of the individual samples in sample_size.


Version 1.3.0

Add default values for unit, temperature and round_to in sensor.py
hcsr04sensor uses metric temperature by default.
Most use cases don't need to specify this and just causes extra typing
for nothing.  But option is there to pass the imperial temperature if you like.

Rounding beyond 1 decimal is pointless as readings on a multi tasking OS will
not be Real Time and will have variance within 1 cm.  
But if you need to you can specify round_to to be greater
than 1

See the provided example scripts for usage.

Version 1.2.0
Python 3 compatibility

Version 1.1.4
Allow changing the default sample size from 11 to a user defined value.  Default

Version 1.1.2 
Improved error handling in sensor.py

Version 1.1.1
